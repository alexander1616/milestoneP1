# NJIT-SD-03 Milestone Project: Planning

## Project Description

_(Replace this text with a brief description of your game and what inspired you to make it.)_

## Game Logic

```
Replace this text with pseudocode.
The pseudocode should describe in plain, simple language the logic of the game.
Describe the logic involved in player decisions. 
  - What are the choices available to the player? 
  - What happens when the player makes a choice?
Describe the logic that evaluates the player's victory/loss/progress status.
```

## Deliverables

### MVP Criteria

- One thing my game must do to meet my minimum standard.
- Another thing.
- Etc.

### Post-MVP Plans

- One great idea I hope to be able to add in before the project deadline.
- Another that will be a stretch.
- Something else I don't technically know how to do... *yet*. :)
