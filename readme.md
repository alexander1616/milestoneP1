# NJIT-SD-03 Milestone Project: Planning

## Project Description

Santa's Snowballs:

The objective of the game is to jump over 10 snowballs! Any collision with the character and the snowball is a loss. The player can make the hero jump with a click.

## Game Logic

```
The hero starts at the bottom left of the screen opposite to the snowball. The game begins when the player presses start, and your sucessful jumps are recorded at the bottom. The movements of both the hero and the snowball is dictated by it's class designation. Once the player presses play, the enemy will begin moving towards the player because it will be assigned the movement class and the player can now assign the jumping class to the hero.
```

## Deliverables

### MVP Criteria

- Lose condition
- Score tracking condition

### Post-MVP Plans

- I'd like to add better graphics, improve functionality, and randomize the snowball speed and movements!
