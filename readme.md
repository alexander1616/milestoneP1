# NJIT-SD-03 Milestone Project: Planning

## Project Description

Tower Defense Game:

The objective of the game is to stay alive and prevent the enemies from reaching the end point for as long as possible. Each round, the number of enemies will increase and stronger enemies will be added every 10 rounds. After 20 enemies reach the end point, the game will end. You are allowed to purchase blocks to alter their predetermined path, and you are also able to purchase 
## Game Logic

```
Replace this text with pseudocode.
The pseudocode should describe in plain, simple language the logic of the game.
Describe the logic involved in player decisions. 
  - What are the choices available to the player? 
  - What happens when the player makes a choice?
Describe the logic that evaluates the player's victory/loss/progress status.
```

## Deliverables

### MVP Criteria

- One thing my game must do to meet my minimum standard.
- Another thing.
- Etc.

### Post-MVP Plans

- One great idea I hope to be able to add in before the project deadline.
- Another that will be a stretch.
- Something else I don't technically know how to do... *yet*. :)
